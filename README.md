# Work Day Planner

This project creates a day planner color-coded by time.

## Description

When the user visits the page, they will have the current date and time displayed at the top of the page in purple. The rest of the page consists of textareas labeled by the hour where the user can input their plans in each textbox. Each timeblock is color-coded. The current hour is highlighted in red, the future hours are highlighted in green, and the past hours are highlighted in gray. When the user inputs their plans, they will click the save button when they're done which will save their plans to their local storage. When they refresh or revist the page, their plans will remain in the textboxes.
